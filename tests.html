    <h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test</h3>
    <p> The MBTI was designed by mother and daughter duo, Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. The test classes an individual into one of 16 unique types by utilising a series of questions. The questions raise certain aspects such as interests, preferences, needs, values, motivation and experiences to determine how an individual fits into the four categories of: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Introversion/Extraversion</li>
      <li>Sensing/Intuition</li>
      <li>Thinking/Feeling</li>
      <li>Judging/Perception</li>
    </ul>

     <p>My results for the Myers-Briggs type indicator resulted with me being an Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging type of person. The qualities of an ISFJ meant that I prefer working alone and strongly focused on facts and details. I believe that working with a team more experienced than I am would bring about my best qualities as I would learn and perform better under others guidance and be forced to work with other people to achieve my best work.
Learning Styles Test
</p>
    <h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>

    <p>The learning styles test is similar to that of the MBTI in that it advances a series of statements or questions to determine the style of learning best suited or is currently used by the individual. The three outcomes of a Learning styles test are: Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic.</p>

    <p>Learning content Visually has always been a technique I used, so it came to no surprise that the results of the learning styles test resulted in this. Although I did know this I believe this information has reinforced this idea now and has made me realise my strong and weak points. Learning and communicating with a team who are also Visual learners would make us work cohesively together in the long run.</p>

    <h3>DISC test</h3>

    <p>The DISC test is a behavioural assessment used in many workplaces and and team based activities as a means of determining which individuals are better suited working together. DISC stands for dominance, influence, steadiness and conscientiousness. The test is in a pie chart format in which a individual can be placed anywhere allowing them to be characterised between two relatable sections. The test can split two 'dominance' individuals up as their ideas and opinions would clash</p>

    <p> Scoring in the lower right quadrant of the steadiness section meant that I’m an open and receptive person with major flaws in taking adapting to new conditions. Qualities of a ‘Steadiness’ person included being patient, reliable and consistent which meant operating within a well-planned project with team is where I would excel at most.</p>
