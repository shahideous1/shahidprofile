    <p>Currently my highest qualification is at Higher School education and my background experience is not in the field of any sub-specialisation of IT. To achieve this goal, I would require completing my studies with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree. My next step would be to obtain a job inside the industry that would allow me to gain experience for my future prospect. Junior Web developer is a great position within the industry to understand the ins and outs whilst also enhancing my own skills in full stack development, software solutions and programming languages.</p>
