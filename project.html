    <p>Buoys are categorised between an anchored or adrift type, and for the most part have not strayed from this concept for over a hundred years. With the exception to buoys designed for weather data collection, tsunami warning, diving and military use, the general population of buoys have remained with its original role to be a visual indication of navigation and physical buoys that boats and ships are able to be moored in. But what if we could release them from their ‘chains’ and allow them to act autonomously with new hardware and software installed?</p>

    <p>The autonomous buoy project is next revolutionary step in technology we place in our ocean and local waters. An autonomous buoy would provide flexibility in what it’s deployed with, making opportunities for what it can be utilised in open waters endless. Programming the buoy can be specific to the user’s preference making revolutionary leaps in safety, data collection and visual assistance.</p>

    <p>This new technology would require a vast amount of new hardware added to meet regulations of international law. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>• Solar Panels – The buoy would require solar panels to allow functionality of all onboard electrical components </li>
      <li>• Global Positioning System - For use as locating, retrieval and navigation for the user</li>
      <li>• Rotating Antenna – emitting S-band and X-band frequencies for its radar system to detect ships, floating objects and land</li>
      <li>• Auto Pilot – Allowing the buoy to direct itself autonomously based on user commands</li>
      <li>• Voyage Data Recorder – Essentially a black box instrument for any seagoing vessels</li>
      <li>• Navigational and Display Lights - Lights are crucial in vessels determining what an object is at sea at night, its direction and also what it’s marking.</li>
      <li>• Horn – Used in gaining attention and also informing port and starboard turns</li>
      <li>• Electrical components - Charge converter, Battery, Inverter are units that will supply power to all hardware onboard</li>
      <li>• Electrically Powered Propeller/s and Rudder – These would allow the buoy to move in the water in tandem with its other hardware used for navigation</li>
      <li>• Onboard Computer – an onboard computer allowing the user to program and communicate with the buoy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to this hardware more equipment can be added for specific purposes like lifesaving appliances or deployable flares for Search and Rescue. Software onboard would be programmed through either C++/Python  which also can be varied depending on user preference.</p>

    <p>A solar powered buoy that is propelled electrically through water. The autonomous nature means it could be programmed to operate within deep sea conditions unlike other buoys that require an anchorage to the sea floor. An autonomous buoy could mean possible advances in;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>• Deep Sea Rubbish Collection</li>
      <li>• Weather Forecasting</li>
      <li>• Endangered Marine Life Tracking</li>
      <li>• Emergency Radio Calls Responsiveness</li>
      <li>• Fuel and Oil Leakage Containment, the list goes on</li>
      


    </ul>

    <p>The successful outcome of this project would mean amazing developments in safety and navigation in our oceans. The programmability of the Autonomous Buoy is only limited to the international laws and local port rules and regulations. With that in mind it can be programmed endlessly and provides flexibility for users.</p>
