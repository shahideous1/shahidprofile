    <p> I was born in Ipswich, Queensland on 30th April 1996 at Ipswich Hospital. My mother is Chinese and was born and raised in Cambodia. She fled to Australia during the Cambodian Civil war. My father is of Pakistani descent and met my mother in Sydney after my he arrived here as a sailor. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to learn either of my parents’ native languages as we speak English predominantly at home.</p>

<p>After graduating high school I worked in a few different industries including hospitality and marketing until I made the decision to join the Australian Defence Force in 2016. In August 2016 I took my oath to serve the Queen in the Royal Australian Navy and left for basic training at HMAS Cerberus. After 12 months I was a fully qualified Boatswain Mate and joined HMAS Canberra, a landing helicopter dock class ship. HMAS Canberra gave me the opportunity to travel the world and make new friendships on the way over my 2 and half year posting onboard. </p>

<p>During my time on HMAS Canberra I had many unforgettable moments. The one memory of my time onboard that will stay with me forever is swimming in the equator as a part of the crossing the line ceremony. The tradition of celebrating new sailors crossing the equator has taken place for decades and I became a part of history that day turning from a ‘pollywog’ to a ‘shellback’. Pollywog is similar to greenhorn, which is used by mariners to class a sailor that is inexperienced. During the Ceremony 'King Neptunes Rex' halts the ship at the equator and demands all pollywogs to be presented before him where his loyal servants proceed to douse the Pollywogs in a stew made by chefs onboard. The day is then spent enjoying the ocean with a number of activities like swimming in open water, food fights and water fights.
</p>

<p>My interest in IT began during my time in the Australian defence force when I was exposed to a number of new technologies onboard HMAS Canberra.I was curious at how all the different components worked not only mechanically but also internally programmed. My Commanding Officer once said to our ships company that a ship is just a ‘metal tub’, and that it’s the people that make it what it is. I believe this is also very relevant in all facets of IT. From phones and laptops to the most advanced armed reconnaissance Helicopters, they’re all ‘metal tubs’ without the IT work put into them. I chose to study at RMIT because it allowed me to be flexible with my studies whilst also working fulltime. During my studies at RMIT I hope to understand how IT works throughout our world and how it impacted our lives everyday.</p>
